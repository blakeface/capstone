#The Jerk Project  
The Jerk project is two parts:  

##Jerkless:  
A hybrid iOS app that tracks "jerks" (changes in acceleration). It has two settings: city and mountain mode.

##Jerkmaps:  
Maps out the Jerkless data and color-codes each geo-point. It also contains a hidden bonus feature...  

Installation:    
$ npm install -g ionic  
$ npm install  
$ cd ionic

To run with an emulator:   
$ ionic emulate ios  

To run with on a browser:  
$ ionic serve ios  


*NOTE*: Due to interpretation differences, Jerkless will display differently between a browser, emulator, and iOS device. Jerkless is configured to show best on an iOS device.
